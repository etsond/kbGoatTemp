      <h1>I am the Goat 🐐</h1>
      <p>
        The name is Kobe Bryant, and he is the Greatest Basketball Palyer of All
        time. he had the hunger, the motivation and the desire to be the best
        possible basketball player that he could be. He is second in All-Star
        appearances (18), won five championships, was MVP, and averaged 25
        points per game. He also was named to the All-Defensive team 12 times,
        second-most in NBA history. There is much about every player's game that
        cannot be measured his heart, passion, work ethic, Mamba mentality, and
        indisputely his impactfulness. Safe to say Mamba Mentality has surpassed
        "Be like Mike".
